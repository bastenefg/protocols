Pipette Calibration
===================

**Frequency:** Once per year  
**Vendor:** VWR / Avantor  

.. note::

   MIT also hosts an onsite *Pipette Calibration Clinic* twice per year.
   This is often more convenient than shipping, since pipettes are only gone for one day.

Overview
--------

Pipette calibration ensures accurate and reproducible liquid handling for all experiments.
This protocol describes how to schedule calibration through VWR/Avantor, prepare pipettes,
and either ship them for service or use the onsite clinic at MIT.

Annual Calibration Options
--------------------------

1. Ship pipettes to VWR/Avantor using their calibration service.
2. Attend the MIT onsite pipette calibration clinic (twice per year).

Shipping Procedure
------------------

1. Contact the current VWR/Avantor account manager for MIT.  
   Request a calibration quote for the pipettes requiring service.

2. Forward the quote to the lab administrator for approval and purchase.  
   The **"Standard" calibration plan** is typically sufficient.

3. Prepare pipettes for shipping:

   - Ensure all pipettes are clean and free of contamination.
   - Disassemble if needed, following manufacturer guidelines. Instructions
     can be found online, for example here:

     `<https://www.pipettesupplies.com/blog-vwr/preventive-maintenance-vwr-ergonomic-high-performance-ehp-single-channel-pipette/>`_

   - Allow all parts to dry completely before packing.

4. Ship the pipettes:

   - Use a shipping box from previous years if available.
   - If none are available, VWR will provide a shipping box when requested.
