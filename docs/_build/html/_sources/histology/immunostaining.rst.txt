Immunostaining Protocol
========================
**Version:** 10-24-24  
**Source:** Bastien

.. note::
   This protocol covers preparation of both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections, followed by immunofluorescence staining.

Frozen Sections
---------------

Tissue Collection, Fixing and Sectioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sacrifice the animal and remove the tissue of interest.
2. Fix tissue in **10% formalin** for **no more than 24 hours at 4°C**.
3. After fixation, transfer tissue to **30% sucrose** overnight.
4. Snap-freeze tissue following a standard protocol.
5. Section tissue at **6–10 µm** using a cryostat  
   (sections up to 20 µm are sometimes used).
6. Use *Poly-L-Lysine–coated slides* to improve adhesion.
7. At least **two sections per block** are required (1 control + 1 stained).
8. Air-dry mounted sections for **20 minutes at room temperature**.  
   Insufficient drying may cause detachment.
9. Store sections in an airtight slide holder at **–80°C**.
10. Before staining, remove slides from –80°C and air-dry under airflow  
    (fume hood recommended) for **30 minutes**.

Paraffin Sections
-----------------

Tissue Collection, Fixing and Sectioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sacrifice the animal and remove the tissue of interest.
2. Fix in **10% formalin** for **no more than 24 hours at 4°C**.
3. Transfer to **70% ethanol** for long-term storage.
4. Submit sample for paraffin embedding.
5. Cut **6 µm** sections on a microtome and dry slides as usual.
6. Deparaffinize using the automated slide processor at the core.  
   **Do not allow slides to dry out** afterward—keep them in PBS or tap water.
7. Perform antigen retrieval:  
   - Immerse slides in **Citrate Buffer (pH 6)**.  
   - Place slides in a **pressure cooker** with water in the bottom.  
   - Run the standard program.
8. When finished, remove slides and cool them by immersing in water.

Immunofluorescence Staining
---------------------------

1. Using a **PAP pen**, draw an unbroken hydrophobic barrier around the tissue.  
   Allow **15–30 minutes** to dry completely.  
   **Do not touch the tissue** with the pen, and do not let the tissue dry out.
2. Wash slides **3 × 5 minutes** in *Wash Buffer* at room temperature.
3. Add **Blocking Buffer** and incubate **60–120 minutes** at room temperature.
4. Wash slides **3 × 5 minutes** in *Wash Buffer*.
5. Add **freshly prepared Permeabilization Buffer** and incubate for **30 minutes**.  
   Do *not* exceed this duration. Permeabilization may not be needed for thin sections.
6. Wash slides **3 × 5 minutes** with *Wash Buffer*.
7. Prepare **Primary Antibody Dilutions** and apply **30–60 µL** per section.
8. Incubate in a **dark humidified chamber**:  
   - **60–120 minutes at room temperature**, *or*  
   - **12–16 hours at 4°C**.
9. Wash **3 × 5 minutes** with *Wash Buffer* to remove unbound antibody.
10. Prepare **Secondary Antibody Dilutions** and apply to slides.
11. Incubate in a dark humidified chamber:  
   - **60–120 minutes at room temperature**, *or*  
   - **12–16 hours at 4°C**.
12. Wash slides **3 × 3 minutes** in *Wash Buffer*.
13. Add **Tissue Autofluorescence Reagent** and incubate **5 minutes** at room temperature.
14. Wash slides **3 × 3 minutes** in *Wash Buffer*.
15. Incubate with **DAPI** for **5 minutes in the dark** at room temperature.
16. Wash slides **3 × 3 minutes** in *Wash Buffer*.
17. Pour off excess buffer and briefly rinse with **1× PBS**.
18. Wipe off excess PBS carefully without disturbing tissue.
19. Mount with **Mounting Medium**:  
    - Add a drop directly onto the tissue.  
    - Gently place coverslip using a razor blade trick to avoid bubbles.  
    - A syringe can help dispense medium without bubbles.
20. Allow slides to dry at **room temperature** until mounting medium sets.
21. Store finished slides at **4°C** for imaging.
