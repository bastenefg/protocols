In-House Trichrome Staining Protocol
====================================

**Based on Newcomer Supply Kit, Part #9179B**  
**Date:** 1/28/25

This protocol is to be used with 4 µm thick sections.  
Reagent volumes assume Coplin jars filled to **40 mL**.

.. note::

   On the first run, include both the unstained **positive control slide provided with the kit** and a **positive control slide of your own**.

Deparaffinization
-----------------

1. Deparaffinize sections thoroughly using the automatic slide stainer at the KI Histology Core.
2. Store slides in **distilled water** for transport back to the lab.

Bouin Fixation
--------------

1. Place slides in a plastic Coplin jar containing **Solution A: Bouin Fluid**.
2. Microwave for **5 minutes at 60°C**.
3. Allow slides to sit an additional **10 minutes** in the solution.
4. Wash well in **running tap water** and then rinse in **DI water**.

Nuclear Staining — Weigert Iron Hematoxylin
-------------------------------------------

1. Prepare fresh Weigert Iron Hematoxylin by mixing:
   
   - **20 mL Solution B**: Ferric Chloride (acidified)  
   - **20 mL Solution C**: Hematoxylin 1% (alcoholic)

2. Stain slides in the **freshly prepared** Weigert Iron Hematoxylin for **10 minutes**.
3. Wash in **running tap water for 10 minutes**, then rinse in **distilled water**.

.. warning::

   If Weigert Iron Hematoxylin is not washed out completely, **nuclear and cytoplasmic staining may be compromised**. Wash thoroughly.

Cytoplasmic Staining
--------------------

1. Place slides in **Solution D: Biebrich Scarlet–Acid Fuchsin (aqueous)** for **2 minutes**.
2. Rinse in **distilled water**.

Collagen Differentiation
-------------------------

1. Place slides in **Solution E: Phosphomolybdic–Phosphotungstic Acid (aqueous)** for **10–15 minutes**.
2. Without rinsing, move directly to **Solution F: Aniline Blue Stain (aqueous)** and stain for **5 minutes**.
3. Rinse in **distilled water**.

.. note::
   This may be a convenient time to transfer the slides back to the histology core.

Acid Wash
---------

1. Place slides in **Solution G: 0.5% Acetic Acid (aqueous)** for **3–5 minutes**.

Dehydration and Clearing
------------------------

1. Dehydrate through:

   - **94% ethanol** (two changes)  
   - **100% ethanol** (two changes)

2. Clear in **three changes of xylene**, **10 dips** each.

Coverslipping
-------------

1. Coverslip with a **Xylene-based mounting medium**.
